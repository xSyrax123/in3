              <span>Electric-Pages</span> is not a site for breaking news about interactive

              these pages to try out new ideas, to support our client research
              and to expand on and document our seminars and workshops, updating
              about once a week. We're experimenting with new tools like audio
              both downloaded and real time, video and animation, and with SGML,
              Acrobat and virtual reality formats. For us at the Lab, new media
              technology doesn't always have to work on the first try; sometimes
              our best analysis comes from talking about how some high tech
              gizmo failed miserably.

            <h3>The history of Electric-Pages</h3>
            <br />
            <p>
              <span>Electric-Pages</span> is the continually developing journal of the Graphics
              Research Laboratory, Inc. in New York City. Established in 1982, the
              lab is a media technology research and education firm, a high tech
              media think tank that helps commercial, corporate and government
              publishers around the world to understand and to implement new
              technology.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              We launched <span>E-P</span> in 1991 at the PRINT 91 exposition in Chicago. It
              began life as a monthly paper-based newsletter mailed the old
              fashioned way to some 500 printing and publishing professionals in
              North America. Following the research and education mission of the
              Graphics Research Lab, our beat has always been the evolution of
              publishing from the Industrial Age batch manufacturing model to the
              Information Age network approach. In those early days, we covered
              new multimedia, CD-ROM, document database and digital printing
              technologies and we described the migration of graphic
              communications imagery to digital formats.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              In 1994, we converted the monthly printed newsletter to an
              interactive fax system driven by a voice response system that also
              included audio excerpts from some of GRLab director Jack Powers'
              seminars and workshops.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              Since January of 1995 we've been on the web with some of our old
              content adapted to hypertext and with all of our new work written
              and edited for continuous hypertext publishing. Of course, many of
              the new pieces cover the Internet and the World Wide Web, but our
              focus is always on the practical publishing concerns: editorial, art
              and design, advertising and marketing, and technology management. We
              try to be analytical in our articles, helpful in our lab notes,
              educational in our courseware and topical in our forums.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
              There have been many changes in publishing and media technology
              since the lab was founded in 1982 and <span>E-P</span> was launched in 1991, and
              sometimes the future of publishing seems unimaginable. But we can
              learn from all of it, the successes and the failures, and build a
              clearer understanding of how humans will communicate with each other
              int he next century.

            <p>
              Our target readers are publishing professionals in commercial,
              corporate and government operations worldwide, a diverse group that
              includes:
            </p>
            <br />

            <p>
              The material is written from a professional publisher's perspective,
              not a layman's viewpoint, but most of the ideas and perspectives are
              quite new and there are plenty of explanations, illustrations and
              examples.
